This project is a walk through of the Stickys Project of [Udemy's Projects in HTML](https://www.udemy.com/projects-in-html5/learn/#/). 

This project was supposed to be created using non-tooled starter template but I used the [gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp) generator via [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and lots of [Bower]() packages.



This project is part of my [portfolio](http://ric.mclaughlin.today/prj_html5_stickys).
